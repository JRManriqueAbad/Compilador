Compiler Project - Based on "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools"

This is my Compiler Project, inspired by the book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" 
(often referred to as the Dragon Book). This repository contains the code(on Python)and resources 
for a compiler that I developed as part of my study of compiler construction concepts.

Overview
This project is an implementation of a compiler, which translates source code written in a custom programming language into machine-readable code. 
The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of compiler design principles and practices outlined in the "Dragon Book."

Features

Lexer and Parser: The project includes a lexer and parser that handle tokenization and syntactic analysis of the input programming language.

Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs semantic analysis to ensure the correctness of the source code's meaning and detects any potential errors.

Intermediate Code Generation: It generates an intermediate representation of the source code, which is an essential step in the compilation process.

Optimization: The compiler applies basic optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency of the generated code.

Code Generation: Finally, the compiler generates target machine code or assembly code from the intermediate representation.

Resources
Dragon Book: The book that inspired this project and serves as a fundamental resource for compiler design.
